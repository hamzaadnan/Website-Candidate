I am a fourth year student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences majoring in Electrical Engineering and Minoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in AI, broadly the following themes:

- Interpretable Neural Networks
- Generative AI
- AI for social good (especially in remote sensing domains)

I am currently a research assistant at the [Center for Urban Informatics, Technology, and Policy](https://city.lums.edu.pk/) (CITY).



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

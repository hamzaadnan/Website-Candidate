I am a fourth year student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences majoring in Electrical Engineering and Minoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in AI, broadly the following themes:

    - Interpretable Neural Networks
    - Generative AI
    - AI for social good (especially in remote sensing domains)

I am currently a research assistant at the [Center for Urban Informatics, Technology, and Policy](https://city.lums.edu.pk/) (CITY).
